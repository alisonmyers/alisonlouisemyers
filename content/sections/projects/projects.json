      "description": "My entrance to data analytics really started with Tableau and data visualization. The data wrangling, scraping, cleaning etc. skills have been developed to complement my desire to build functional dashboards that allow folks to make data-supported decisions. I quickly learned that if I wanted to build the best dashboards then I wanted to have the skills to get the data in the best possible shape to do so. This approach has given me a deep appreciation for the advanced capabilities of Tableau, and why I take a functional-first approach to Tableau. You will find my profile mostly contains dashboards that are used to demonstrate functionality and/or are used to complement various Tableau tutorials and workshops. üì∏ Photo by Carlos Muza on Unsplash.",

Embedded within a team of instructional support staff, we developed a series of tools using the available APIs (REST and GraphQL) to extend the functionality of the LMS. üì∏ Photo by Barn Images on Unsplash.",
