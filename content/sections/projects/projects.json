      "description": "I completed UBC's Master of Education program in 2022. Fondly known as the MET program, the mix of hands-on and theoretical learning ultimately produced a body of work that showcases my desire to learn by doing. The goal was to 'show off' artifacts I built throughout the program, but I wanted to do so in a way that allowed me to experiment with new technologies - enter Gatsby and React! \n Photo by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash",
