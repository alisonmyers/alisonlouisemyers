The data wrangling, scraping, cleaning etc. skills have been developed to complement my desire to build functional dashboards that allow folks to make data-supported decisions. I quickly learned that if I wanted to build the best dashboards then I wanted to have the skills to get the data in the best possible shape to do so. ðŸ“¸ Photo by Carlos Muza on Unsplash.",

However, the LMS doesn't always 'do' what we need it to, or make data available in an accessible way. We developed a series of tools using the available APIs (REST and GraphQL) to extend the functionality of the LMS. ðŸ“¸ Photo by Barn Images on Unsplash.",

Fondly known as the MET program, the mix of hands-on and theoretical learning ultimately produced a body of work that showcases my desire to learn by doing. The goal was to 'show off' artifacts I built throughout the program, but I wanted to do so in a way that allowed me to experiment with new technologies - enter Gatsby and React! ðŸ“¸ Photo by Susan Q Yin on Unsplash",
