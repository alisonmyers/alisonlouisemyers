The content in this portfolio is my own, but I that believe attribution is critically important, especially as more and more technology exists in the "open".  

🔁 This portfolio was adapted from the Gatsby Starter "Portfolio Minimal" developed by <a href="https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-starter-portfolio-minimal-theme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Konstantin Münster</u></a>.
